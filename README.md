# Car-Advertisement
This is a TripleTen Sprint 4 project to develop and deploy a web application regarding car sales advertisements to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public. I will edit and explore the data, then organize it by plotting the data in graphs and charts on the live streaming service. 

# Description

The dataframe has been put in to three graphs. The first is a scatterplot showing the odometer versus price. The second is a histogram that shows the odometer, price and model year. The third is a scatterplot showing the breakdown of manufacture, model, model year, and price of the vehicles.
